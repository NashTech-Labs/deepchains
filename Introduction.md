#Introduction of Blockchain
*"Blockchain is more than just ICT innovation, but facilitates new types of economic organization and governance. Suggests two approaches to economics of blockchain: innovation-centred and governance-centred. Argues that the governance approach—based in new institutional economics and public choice economics—is most promising, because it models blockchain as a new technology for creating spontaneous organizations, ie new types of economies.”*

**- Primavera De Fillippi, Academic, researcher, author and thought leader**

Sometimes people consider **bitcoin** and **blockchain** as one but the bitcoins are digital crypto-currency and blockchain are the technology enables digital currency from one indiviaual to another. Blockchains solves the problem in money transfer. Today if a person wants to transfer his or her money to another person the he/she then it is done through a third trusted party which takes time and fees for the transfering money.
The blockchain was conceptualized by **Satoshi Nakamoto** in **2008** and implemeneted as a core component of bitcoin but now used for other crypto-currency, online signature services, and many other applications.

A blockchain is a  peer to peer technology that protects the integrity of a digital piece of information. It is a distributed public ledger or database that maintains a list of blocks. Each block contains a hash(A hash algorithm turns an arbitrarily-large amount of data into a fixed-length hash) of previous block hence creates a chronological order. Every node gets a copy of the ledger and each time any transcation occurs it is broadcasted over the blockchain network. Whenever any node connects with the network it gets automatically downloaded.

A blockchain has two main concepts:

1. Distributed Network
2. Open Ledger
